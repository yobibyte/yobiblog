# yobibyte.github.io

Hi there! My nave is Vitaly Kurin and currently I'm a Juniour Researcher in [Morpheus Labs](http://morpheuslabs.co.uk/) in Oxford. 
More info can be found [here](https://github.com/yobibyte/yobiblog/blob/master/pages/about.md).

## What is that??? o_O

This is yobiblog. Why having problems with static blog generators? Why solve dependencies problems all the time? Only Github, only markdown, only hardcore!

## How can I use this

Think that it is my 'index.html' page. Below you will find the links to the posts (each post is an issue) and all the stuff. Welcome!
