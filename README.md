# yobibyte.github.io

Hi there! My nave is Vitaly Kurin and currently I'm a master student at [RWTH University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). I also work as a student assistant at [Computer Vision lab](http://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/) with [Lucas Beyer](http://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/person/11/) and professor [Bastian Leibe](http://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/person/1/). More info can be found [here](https://github.com/yobibyte/yobiblog/blob/master/pages/about.md).

## What is that??? o_O

This is yobiblog. Why having problems with static blog generators? Why solve dependencies problems all the time? Only Github, only markdown, only hardcore!

## How can I use this

Think that it is my 'index.html' page. Below you will find the links to the posts (each post is an issue) and all the stuff. Welcome!
